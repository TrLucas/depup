# Closed Developement

Developement in this repository is now stopped in favor of [the actual fork](https://github.com/TrLucas/codingtools/tree/eyeo_depup/eyeo-depup).

# Easy dependency updating

## Introduction

This program is meant to ease the process of gathering information /
preparing an issue on issues.adblockplus.org, in order to update a given
dependency.

You can run this program to get a list of potentially included changes
(represented by their commit messages). You can create a unified diff of all
potentially included changes or you can create an issue body, which is supposed
to be filed on https://issues.adblockplus.org. After filing an issue and hence
having a corresponding issue number, you can commit the necessary changes in
order to actually perform a dependency update.

Since there won't be any way to bridge submodules / subrepositories between
Git and Mercurial any time soon, we will stay dependent on a manual approach
for mirroring these ourselves.

## Requirements

 - [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)
 - [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
 - [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/)

_(Please note, as soon as https://hg.adblockplus.org/buildtools/file/tip/ensure_dependencies.py
is made Python 3.* compatible, the requirement for Python 2.7.* will be removed.)_

## Compatibility

This program runs with both Python 2.7.* and Python 3.*.

## Installation

Execute setup.py:
```
$ python setup.py install
```

_Please note: setup.py will additionally install
[jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.9/) on your machine._

## Limitations

Mainly due to humans being involved in reporting issues, there is no guarantee
that looking up integration notes will find everything that is needed to be
done, in order to update to a new revision.

## Running the programm

Simply call the executable inside a repository which as dependencies.
A few examples:

### Show a list of changes between the current revision and the remote master for adblockpluscore

```
$ depup changes adblockpluscore
```

Result:

```
( dbfc37143497 ) : Noissue - Fix the escaping of '{' and '}' in CSS selectors (by Hubert Figuière)
( 1bb277740973 ) : Issue 5160 - Alias new class names and properties. (by Hubert Figuière)
( 280efb445cc1 ) : Issue 5147 - Invalidate wrapper on delete (by Hubert Figuière)

```

### Generate a bare issue body for updating to the local master branch/bookmark (-r master), without mirroring Git if Mercurial is used (or vice versa) to figure out the corresponding revision (-s)

```
$ depup issue adblockpluscore -r master -s
```

Result:

```

### Print information on the last 5 commits (-r HEAD~5) and lookup possible "Integration Notes" for those (-l)

```
(gitrepo)$ depup changes adblockpluscore -r HEAD~5 -l
```

Result:
```
WARNING: you are trying to downgrade the dependency!

```

### Generate a unified diff for the changes to buildtools @ remote master
```
$ depup diff buildtools
```

Result:
```
diff --git a/.gitignore b/.gitignore
index 4090c27..5832582 100644
--- a/.gitignore
+++ b/.gitignore
@@ -1,3 +1,6 @@

```

### Commit all necessary changes (along with file updates done by ensure_dependencies.py) to perform a dependency update
**Note**: You must have already created an issue and know the corresponding
issue number for this
```
$ depup commit buildtools 5698
```

Result:
```
Issue 5698 - Update buildtools to 1c798cc8b402 / 9643c0
```

## Help

Depup comes with an integrated help page for each subcommand. The full pages:

### Root

```
usage: depup [-h] [subcommand] ...

This script executes the automatable work which needs to be done for a
dependency update and provides additional information, i.e. a complete
diff of imported changes, as well as related integration notes.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help    show this help message and exit

Subcommands:
  [subcommand]  Required, the actual command to be executed. Execute run

## Templating

You can provide your own template, which can be rendered with all available information. The default template renders as shown in the above example.

There are at any time these values exposed to the template:

- `repository` - the repository to update (equals the positional argument of depup).
- `raw_changes` - the unparsed but mirrored list of changes (if existing, the item at index 0 is the revision to update to), each item containing the following key/value pairs:
  * `author` - the author of the commit.
  * `message` - the commit message, stripped to the first line.
  * `date` - The commit date, in the rfc822 format.
  * `git_hash` - the git hash of the commit, (mirrored if root VCS is mercurial, 'NO MIRROR' if mirroring was skipped)
  * `git_url` - the revisions' url @ www.github.com
  * `hg_hash` - the mercurial hash of the commit, (mirrored if root VCS is git, 'NO MIRROR' if mirroring was skipped)
  * `hg_url` - the revisions url @ hg.adblockplus.org
- `issue_ids` - A list of encountered Issue ids or an empty array.
- `noissues` - Changes which could not be associated with an issue id. Either an empty array, or a list of dictionaries, each containing the same key/value pairs as `raw_changes`
- `hg_hash` - the mercurial hash for the new revision ('NO MIRROR' if mercurial is the mirror's vcs and mirroring is skipped)
- `git_hash` the git hash for the new revision ('NO MIRROR' if git is the mirror's vcs and mirroring is skipped)

For more information, please consult [the jinja2 documentation](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.9/).

### Example template

The following template generates an issue body, from which the line in "What to change"
can be copied to the dependencies file.

Additionally, the hashes in the "What to change" section are hyperlinks to
their respective hosts.

```
SUBJECT:
Update {{ repository }} dependency to {{ hg_hash }}

=== Background ===

CHANGE ME!

=== Included changes in `{{ repository }}` ===

{% for change in noissues -%}
|| [{{ change.hg_url }} {{ change.hg_hash }}] || {{ change.message }} || {{ change.author }} ||
